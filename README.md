# Neural-Network
An **object-oriented** python module intended for building and teaching rather small neural networks.


# Usage
**In case anybody would like to use the code:**
> I recomend simply copying only the main module file - `neural_network.py` into your project's **root folder**, and importing just the right staff in your scripts, for example like that:

```py
from neural_network import Network, soft_max
```


# Examples
- To run example scripts, you can use folowing syntax **(while in project's directory)**:

```sh
python3 -m examples.<example_name_without_file_extension>
```

- `adjust-sinus.py` script requires `turtle` module to draw the resoult.
- If you get bored with waiting for the AI to learn more, consider clicking `Ctrl + c` to finish the script and to see the best resoult found at that point.
- At the top part of the example code, you can edit parameters of the math-function f(x) to be drawn.
